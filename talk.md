# Talk 05/14/2018 - Can we save the planet with AI? by Raphael Koch

## Slide 1 -- Welcome
Can we actually save the planet with AI or will it just end in a huge catastrophe?
Today I will give you a look into this topic. I try to show that AI is not just pour evil that will take over the world as Hollywood tries to make us believe. But also the significant drawbacks this solution takes with it.

## Slide 2 -- Believers
So is AI the solution? Well according some of the most influential groups on our planet it is, and they working hard to make it a reality. For example Microsoft just announced a 50 Million US Dollar plan. Microsoft is committing 50 Million US Dollar over the next five years to put artificial technology in the hands of individuals and organizations around the world who are working to protect our planet. The World Economic Forum called it even "an historic moment for AI" but mainly focuses on the economic benefits of this technology, obviously. According to them, is especially 2018 a significant year. It's the year where everyone is starting to see the business value of AI. AI is being propelled out of the research labs and into our everyday lives. But this also includes risks. We already talked about them during this course. Risks include: bias, poor decision making, low transparency, job losses, and malevolent use of AI, such as autonomous weaponry. But today I will less focus on guiding us towards a "human friendly AI" but more towards ensuring an "Earth friendly AI". We will look into how we can use this technology to not only have an impact on economy and human health but also how we can transform traditional sectors and systems to address climate change, deliver foot and water security all over the world, build sustainable cities, and protect biodiversity and human wellbeing.
