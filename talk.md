# Talk 05/14/2018 - Can we save the planet with AI? by Raphael Koch

## Slide 1 -- Welcome
Can we actually save the planet with AI or will it just end in a huge catastrophe?
Today I will give you a look into this topic. I try to show that AI is not just pour evil that will take over the world as Hollywood tries to make us believe. But also the significant drawbacks this solutions take with it.

## Slide 2 -- Believers
So is AI the solution? Well according some of the most influential groups on our planet it is, and they working hard to make it a reality. For example Microsoft just announced a 50 Million US Dollar plan. Microsoft is committing 50 Million US Dollar over the next five years to put artificial technology in the hands of individuals and organizations around the world who are working to protect our planet. The World Economic Forum called it even "an historic moment for AI" but mainly focuses on the economic benefits of this technology, obviously. According to them, is especially 2018 a significant year. It's the year where everyone is starting to see the business value of AI. AI is being propelled out of the research labs and into our everyday lives. But this also includes risks. We already talked about them during this course. Risks include: bias, poor decision making, low transparency, job losses, and malevolent use of AI, such as autonomous weaponry. But today I will less focus on guiding us towards a "human friendly AI" but more towards ensuring an "Earth friendly AI". We will look into how we can use this technology to not only have an impact on economy and human health but also how we can transform traditional sectors and systems to address climate change, deliver foot and water security all over the world, build sustainable cities, and protect biodiversity and human wellbeing.

## Slide 3 -- The Challenges

Our planet is under unprecedented stress. The humans industrial development during the industrial revolution has largely come at the expense of the planet. For 10'000 years, the Earth's relative stability has enabled civilization to thrive. But now just in few hundred years we have put this stability at risk. The climate change, which was predicted as early as 1900, has become a reality. The biodiversity decreases everyday and the oceans chemistry has changed. And this are a just a few challenges, we as a species have to face to give a future generation a future.

## Slide 4/5 -- United Nations Sustainable Development Goals

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals proved another lens for the challenges facing humanity. Six of the 17 goals apply directly to the environment and humans' influence over it.

## Slide 6 -- Focus points
For this talk I will focus on six problems, which we can hopefully solve with the help of AI.
* Climate change
* Biodiversity and conservation
* Healthy oceans
* Water security
* Clean air
* Weather and disaster resilience

Taken together, these six issues pose an urgent global challenge. The demand of humans from our planet will increase, mainly due to growing population. So to give our future generations a planet to live on, we have to do something.

## Slide 7 -- Climate change

Hopefully I don't have to explain climate change and global warming to you, so I will skip this and go directly to the parts where we can change something with the help of AI. So today's greenhouse gas levels may be the highest in 3 million years. And even if everyone will hold up to the Paris Agreement, the global average temperatures in 2100 are still expected to be 3Â°C above pre-industrial levels, which is already well above the targets to avoid the worst.  

The first main point where we can take action is energy. In 2016 only 24% of all the electricity produced, was from renewable source. There are a few leading countries such as Norway with nearly 98% from renewable source but the majority is still way behind. Of course the keyword _power_ goes beyond electricity, there is also oil etc. but electricity is currently the core problem or to be more precise the production and transportation of electricity. And that's where AI can help. For example with more intelligent distribution: By getting data from producers and consumers, it is possible to optimize the energy forecasting, and building a smart grid. We can build optimized decentralized and peer-to-peer renewable energy systems with the help of AI and Blockchain for example. Or by analyzing the data of the sun with the help of AI we can predict solar flares and thus protect the power grids.

An other part where AI is a key system is transportation, such as autonomous vehicles or shared transport on-demand. Systems which are more efficient than a human can ever possibly be. But we already heard about this part in a different talk.

Sustainable production and consumption means a monitored and transparent supply chain, and active optimization of the industry by further autotomizing the production. But also smart recycling systems or integrated municipal and industrial waste management, to decrease the waste we produce and to further reuse as much as possible. This will not only help the climate but the planet as a whole.

The use of AI will also not stop before the farming industry. There are huge benefits of this system there. With the help of big data, we build a system that can predict crop yield or nutrition management. With better weather forecasting it will be possible to not only manage the corps better but also the detect early on if there are issues. With AI driven satellites we can automate and enhance land-use change detection to avoid deforestation.

Last but not least are smart cities and homes, we already talk about this a lot. So I will only give some further option. For example smart traffic light and parking system for urban mobility management. AI will generally help to analyze a city or a home and automate urban management and planning.

## Slide 8 -- Biodiversity and conservation

The Earth is losing its biodiversity at mass extinction rates. One in five species on Earth now faces eradication. Current deforestation rates in the Amazon basin could lead to an 8% drop in regional rainfall by 2050, which will lead to wider consequences for the Earth's atmospheric circulatory systems.

With the help of AI we can get a better understanding of the interlink on the Earth as a whole. For example it makes it possible to predict bird habitats and migration patterns. We can simulate animal and habitat interaction to better protect them or if we can not stop the dying of the bees. We can build AI driven micro drones for pollination and thus also optimize breeding of plants.

With the help of satellites and AI it makes it easier to go against illegal wildlife capture or trading. We can also as mention in the part before build a optimized food trading chain and tracking it's origin.

Pollution control will get simpler with AI driven simulations. We can predict them and track them. Analyze it and make something against it.

## Slide 9 -- Healthy oceans

The chemistry of the oceans is changing. They absorb greenhouse gases and the result is acidification and warming. This causes unprecedented damage to fish and corals. Over 50% of the world's coral reefs have died in the last 30 years and up to 90% may die within the next century. A world without corals not only means we will have a less diverse ocean, but it will be also an economic disaster for many people especially in developing countries. Fishery and tourism will have direct impact of this, but also coastal protection especially in areas frequently impacted by hurricanes and tropical storms. The great biodiversity of coral reefs serves as an important source for new medical therapeutics, so losing them is not just a lose of biodiversity and species but also a lose of an possible opportunities.

Here again is mainly monitoring the main usage of AI. We can automate overfishing control and catch thresholds. But also with insights for fisherman. AI can detect and alarm illegal fishing activities and optimize patrol schedules.

Further to fight and prevent further ocean pollution, with marine litter prediction by analyzing and simulating ocean currents, or by AI driven robotic fish to actively fight pollution such as plastic.

AI could also help in form of autonomous vehicles which map and monitor the oceans, to better understand how the whole system works together. This will help us to better protect habitats and conserve what is not lost yet. We can protect species predict there routes. For example by analyzing moving patterns of whales and other big marine wildlife to help giving them save passages be rerouting container ships and decrease unnecessary contact.

All this points need real-time monitoring which will be made easier with the help of AI driven systems. Monitoring the pH values of the water and the ocean temperature, monitor ocean currents and coral reef ecosystems.

## Slide 10 -- Water security

By 2030, we may fall 40% short of the amount of fresh water needed to support the global economy as pollution and climate change affect the global water cycle. The main problem of water usage is, that we tend to forget where fresh water is used. If we think about it mostly the the first things that pop up are toilet, shower, cloths and dishes washing, drinking and food production. But by a study in the US they found out that 12% alone of the water usage in households in 2016 was from leaks in the pipes. An other thing is the industry. Here again the first thing that comes to mind is farming. It is indeed a huge consumer in the US in 2010 it was around 36%, but by far not the largest consumer. The largest consumer is thermoelectric power with around 45%, those are power plants such as nuclear, coal or oil.

AI can help in monitoring again. By monitoring the water supply we are able to better manage it. It will be possible to simulate the supply and get a faster understanding of changes in water quality and can step in with self-adaptive water filtration, which costs a lot and can thus lower the cost of fresh water.

We can early on detect algal blooms and thus lower the harm this can take with it. Further on with AI based monitoring of the landscape we can forecast the stream-flow and automate flood centered infrastructure.

Smart homes can monitor and manage the water it uses. we can optimize the industrial water use, predict maintenance of water plants and generate early warning system for water infrastructure. By constantly monitoring the water running through pipes, underground leaks get detected early on and can be fixed more efficiently.

AI driven drones can real-time monitoring of rivers and lakes possible. This will not only help to increase the quality of fresh water but also of oceans. A big amount of the oceans' toxins come from rivers leading into it. An we can ensure adequate sanitation of water reserves.

All this data will also help prediction droughts. We can run simulations for drought planning and thus can lower the impact the drought will have. Like this we can prevent situations from happening as it currently does in Cape Town or California.

## Slide 11 -- Clean Air

Around 92% of the world's people live in places that fail to meet World Health Organization air quality guidelines. According to the WHO, around 7 million people die annually from exposure to air pollution. This is one death out of every eight globally!

With AI we can optimize sensor-based air purifying systems. Building carbon capture and storage systems. Real-time air pollution monitoring and simulation allows us to detect the source. With enough data we will even have to ability to forecast pollution levels. Which will help not only in warning humans but also in transport management.

Well sounds to have the option to forecast air pollution but it would be way better to solution to get rid of pollution as a whole and change to clean fuels. Here can AI also help. AI works better with huge amount of data than humans do, so AI can help the industry and researches to build advanced batteries and fuel-cell designs.

## Slide 12 -- Weather and disaster resilience



## Final word

AI will change our future. It will change how we live, how we work, probably even how we interact with each other in the future. So let's take that opportunity we have and lead it into a direction that will benefit all of us.

Thank you.
